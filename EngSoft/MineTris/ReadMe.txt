	Welcome to freecell.n3.net for information of FreecellTool, the author's another software, which can help you solve freecell puzzle.

System requirement:
=======
	A PC with sound card running win95/98/2000 or NT4.
	Notice: if no sound card is installed on your machine, please turn off "Midi music" and "Sound effect" settings in "Options" menu. The game will be less interesting without sound, especially when you make a mistake, you cannot know it instantly. 

How to install:
=======
	There are two versions of package. 
	The "MineTris.zip" version: Unzip the zip file and run "MineTris.exe".
	The "Setup.exe" version: run the exe file and follow the instructions.

How to play:
=======
	The operation is very like MineSweeper; here is the difference between MineTris and MineSweeper:
1. No "Mark as ?" function.
2. You can push both left and right button of the mouse to an empty grid.
3. Only every grid of the line is opened or MARKED can this line be removed.
4. The top line cannot be removed.
5. You will be punished if you make "open error". "Open error" means a grid has a mine, but you open it. You will not be punished for "mark error"(a grid has no mine, but you mark it), except that this grid is the last unknown grid of the line. 
6. The speed will increase every time you remove 20 lines. If you achieve level 20, the speed will not increase any more.
7. If only 4 lines remain, the system will give 5 point, and some extra grids.
8. You can customize the game. If you think your custom setting is better than the system, please tell me your settings.

Hints:
=======
1. Not like MineSweeper, MineTris is "error allowed". If you make mistake, you will get punished instead of "game over". Try open or mark some grids bravely when you are in danger.
2. Do not remove all the "half opened" lines. Keep some lines "half opened" to help explore into new field.
3. The "beginner" level is recommended for all players. The "intermediate" level has a larger window but is much easier than others. The "Expert" level is difficult and time costing.
4. You can overwrite files in "Music" folder to change the music and sound.
